## Executive Summary
**Blinkit** one of India's leading last-minute grocery and convenience apps, has rapidly expanded its presence across various city tiers and product categories. Despite its success, there are critical business challenges affecting the companyâ€™s long-term growth and profitability. This analysis delves into Blinkit's sales performance and identifies key issues surrounding product distribution, outlet efficiency, sales trends, and consumer behavior. The goal is to offer actionable recommendations for optimizing sales and improving Blinkit's overall operational strategy.

The analysis shows that while sales in Tier 3 cities have exceeded expectations, Blinkit has struggled to maintain consistent growth in the post-2018 period. A significant decline in sales, particularly in medium and small outlets, has raised questions about marketing effectiveness, product performance, and consumer engagement. Additionally, variations in consumer purchasing behavior especially around health-conscious options require further strategic attention.

By optimizing distribution, refining inventory management, and addressing changing consumer preferences, Blinkit can restore growth momentum, improve profitability, and strengthen its market position.

2. Ineffective Outlet Strategies: The performance of small and medium outlets has been lackluster, while large outlets continue to dominate.
3. Unoptimized Product Distribution: Certain product categories have underperformed, suggesting a mismatch between customer demand and inventory.
4. Changing Consumer Behavior: The increasing demand for healthier, low-fat products is not being sufficiently addressed in the product portfolio.

## Objective

The key business objectives are:
1. Increase Sales in Tier 3 Cities: Leverage growing demand in Tier 3 cities to boost total sales and expand market reach.
